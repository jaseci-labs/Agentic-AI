```json
{
  "utterance": "{{YOU CAN ASK THE QUESTION HERE}}",
  "session_id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
  "agent_id": "{{AGENT_ID}}",
  "tts": "false",
  "data": {},
  "verbose": "false",
  "streaming": "false"
}
```

**OpenAI API Key Configuration**

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/walker/update_action
```

**Sample JSON Payload**

```json
{
  "reporting": true,
  "agent_id": "{{AGENT_ID}}",
  "action_id": "n:LangChainModelAction:688f65a4f45c35658ca0fb2e",
